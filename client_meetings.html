                <h2>Questions/Plan</h2><br>
                    <p> 
                        Current Context and the Problem<br>
                        What is UVic? University of Victoria<br>
                        How many students attend? 21593 students as of 2015 <br>
                        Is there an estimate of how many will eat on campus on a given day at the intended location of change? <br>
                        ~2000<br>
                        How many food service locations exist and of what type are they? <br>
                        There are 9 food service locations; building 1, port cafe, cove express, mystic market, mac’s, bibliocafe, arts place, nibbles and bytes, and sci cafe<br>
                        What are the current wait times? <br>
                        busy:10-20min not busy:5min<br>
                        When are the slowest “gap times” when traffic becomes most congested? <br>
                        noonish 11-1 on 20 and 50<br>
                        Who are the stakeholders involved in the current system? <br>
                            students,visitors,staff<br>
                        Who is most disadvantaged by the problem?<br>
                            students,visitors,staff<br>
                        Ordering wait-times are listed as the primary problem? Is increasing sales a goal, or to keep them consistent? <br>
                        Reduce wait times which will increase sales<br>
                        What locations are currently most congested and would benefit the most/the least? Are there locations to prioritize? <br>
                        sub,mystic<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Payment<br>
                        What is the OneCard? How does it work as a payment system? Is it private/public? Who is eligible to have the card?<br>
                        OneCard is the identification card used at the University of Victoria. It also provides a method of payment for students along with discounts when used at UVic locations. It is private as it is only eligible to students and staff at the university.<br>
                        
                        Are there currently incentives/discounts for using OneCard or other forms of payment? <br>
                        10% off<br>
                        <br>
                        How many methods of payment currently exist at food service locations? How many/which ones should exist in a solution? <br>
                        cash onecard credit debit<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        System limitations/goals<br>
                        <br>
                        What are the requirements/limitations for the food service workers for the system to be implemented? Hardware? Software? Training? (Who manages equipment/training/maintenance of equipment) <br>
                        All food outlets will require a food ordering - application, qr code, scanner?<br>
                        <br>
                        How are no-shows handled? What if a user orders food, but does not pick up? Can orders be canceled/refunded? (User side/worker side) <br>
                        orders only canceled if not started by worker then customer gets coupon(rare)<br>
                        no shows no refund after not showing during pickup window<br>
                        <br>
                        What should the mobile app present to the user to know if order is confirmed/when to pick up?<br>
                        Yes - user should get a notification saying “Your order is ready”<br>
                        How will workers confirm the clients’ orders to their identity?<br>
                        qrcode<br>
                        alternative sign in, guest/one card user<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        potential idea<br>
                        fastlane system where online orders get a seperate lineup to let them bypass the not ready customers who need to order as well<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Requirements for Change - Note: for future meetings<br>
                        How should students become aware of the new ordering option? Do the clients want the majority of orders to be processed through the product? - how significant of a shift overall (change management considerations)<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        How do cooks currently manage students ordering food? Are cooks and cashiers separate roles? Does taking an order slow down the cooking process? (Future Q: Will you need more cooks if the solution is implemented?)<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
