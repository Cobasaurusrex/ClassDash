                <h3>Client Organization: </h3><br>
                <p>Our client organization is the UVic University Food Services which offers a variety of food outlets across campus that are heavily trafficked everyday by students and staff. At the flagship Mystic Market location, cooks at seven food kiosks prepare in-house meals to field most of the University’s daily lunch traffic - resulting in long lines and delays for hungry patrons during these peak hours. Increasing the efficiency of the ordering process is a priority to better serve patrons and increase their sales. <p><br>
                <h3>Project Description</h3><br>
                <p>The ClassDASH project was initiated after receipt of the Request for Proposal for a mobile food ordering
                    solution by the University of Victoria’s (UVic) Food Services. The several food outlets across campus
                    offering a variety of foods to students, faculty, staff, and guests, were experiencing significant traffic at
                    peak hours. This resulted in long lines and delays for hungry patrons -- many of whom could not always
                    afford to wait in line before their next course or appointment. Therefore, a mobile ordering solution
                    allowing patrons to submit their order ahead of time and pick up at their convenience was desired as a
                    solution that could better serve patrons, and increase the efficiency of ordering and sales for Food
                    Services. Consequently, upon delivery of the ClassDASH app, changes will be both experienced by the
                    Food Service organization and their employees, as well as their hungry patrons, entailing important
                    change management considerations. To ensure buy-in and clear lines of communication, key stakeholders
                    were identified, including representatives from the UVic Food Services, the UVic Student Society, and the
                    UVic Committee.
                    The primary goals of the project are fourfold:<br>
                    1) To acquire at least 50% user base for students who consume one meal on campus a day (approx.
                    1350)<br>
                    2) For students who consume at least two meals a day on campus, to cover at least 30% of their meal
                    orders through the system<br>
                    3) To avoid food waste through the implementation of the system; minimizing the volume of
                    abandoned orders<br>
                    4) Clear the congestion in front of shops by diverting what would be line-up orders through the
                    system</p><br>
